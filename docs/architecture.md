# AWS Infrastructure Architecture

This document provides an overview of the AWS infrastructure architecture created using Terraform for the showcase project.

## Infrastructure Components

### Networking (VPC)
- **VPC**: Isolated network environment with custom CIDR block
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- **Internet Gateway**: Allows communication between VPC and the internet
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic flow between subnets and gateways

### Compute (EC2)
- **EC2 Instance**: Hosts the application server
- **Security Groups**: Control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances
- **Key Pair**: Secure SSH access to instances

### Database (RDS)
- **RDS Instance**: Managed MySQL database
- **DB Subnet Group**: Spans multiple availability zones for high availability
- **Security Group**: Restricts access to the database

### Storage (S3)
- **S3 Bucket**: Object storage for application assets
- **Bucket Versioning**: Maintains multiple versions of objects
- **Server-Side Encryption**: Encrypts data at rest
- **Public Access Block**: Prevents unintended public access

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **IAM Roles**: Define permissions for AWS services
- **IAM Policies**: Specify allowed actions on AWS resources
- **Instance Profile**: Attaches IAM roles to EC2 instances

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**:
   - Private subnets for sensitive resources
   - Security groups with least privilege access
   - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets

2. **Data Security**:
   - Encryption at rest for S3 and RDS
   - Secure transmission using HTTPS/SSL

3. **Access Control**:
   - IAM roles with minimal permissions
   - SSH key-based authentication for EC2 instances
   - No public database access

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**:
   - Resources distributed across multiple availability zones
   - Automatic failover for critical services

2. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - S3 versioning for object recovery
   - RDS automated backups

## Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - VPC designed to accommodate additional resources
   - Subnets sized for growth

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Instance types can be upgraded as needed
   - Database instance class can be modified

## Cost Optimization

1. **Right-sizing**:
   - Appropriate instance types for each environment
   - Smaller instances for dev/staging environments

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Shared resources where appropriate
   - Environment-specific configurations

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow automates:
- Code validation
- Infrastructure planning
- Deployment to different environments
- Documentation of changes
